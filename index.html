          <!-- beauty, simplicity, design, efficient, streamlined, clean, concise, elegant, intuitive -->

          I value longevity and aspire to build things that last.
          For renovating a house, that means avoiding the temptation to cut corners and repurposing quality materials where possible.
          For building software, that means that the simplicity and utility of the user interface must be matched by clean architecture and efficient code under the hood.
          As a professional I gravitate toward opportunities to build scientific computing software for R&D-intensive organizations.
          But I find just as much satisfaction crafting a web app that uses intuitive data visualizations to convey knowledge in a new and interactive way.

          <!-- Utilitarian, simple, intuitive, clean, efficient&mdash;these are descriptors of longevity.
          And when something is built with simplicity in mind, when every extraneous bit is stripped away, the end result is elegance and beauty.
          Whether crafting an algorithm or an archway in my home, I take great pleasure in -->
        </p>

        <!-- <p>
          My graduate training is in high-fidelity multidisciplinary design optimization, which involves developing accurate and efficient computational models of physical systems, customizing them to interface with a gradient-based optimizer, and running parallelized programs on HPC clusters.
          I have experience developing optimization software and architecting system models in Cameo at Northrop Grumman.
          I am interested in opportunities to develop computational models of physical processes and harness these models to inform design decisions.

            The design of an aircraft is determined by the demands of business aims, government regulations, and the hard facts of physics.
            Multidisciplinary problems like aircraft design, which can have thousands of design variables and constraints, are only tractable using a gradient-based optimizer with adjoint derivatives.
            To realistically optimize an aircraft wing requires solving coupled computational models of fluid dynamics and structural mechanics and then propagating sensitivities of the functions of interest (lift, drag, weight, etc.) through the models to obtain derivatives with respect to design variables.
            Armed with adequate and accurate information, an optimizer can explore a design space more comprehensively than has traditionally been possible by passing a design back and forth between disciplines in an engineering organization.
            However, the question arises whether the tools are sensitive enough to traverse the design space without getting stuck in artificial local minima.
            This dissertation explores the phenomena of local minima in aircraft design problems and demonstrates the remarkable capability of an optimizer to predictably traverse a large design space to arrive at an optimal solution.

        <p>
          From California and Ohio, respectively, my wife and I and decided early on to make the most of opportunities to venture out and live in new places.
          With our (now) three little girls, we've made homes in the Midwest, the Mountain West, and on both coasts.
          In LA, we lived our best beach life and walked to the beach multiple times a week.
          In Utah, we spent nearly every weekend and some weekdays teaching our 4 and 2-year-olds how to ski.
          And now, we spend all our spare time fixing up a rowhome in the city.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm an engineer by training and profession, and my graduate field of study was in optimization and computational physics modeling.
          Along the way, I've gravitated toward scientific software development and find great satisfaction in facilitating techonlogical advancements through elegant and user-friendly software solutions.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm a reader not a gamer.
          I rarely watch shows but I love movies.
          I'm not a sports fan but I enjoy playing sports.
          I'm glad everyone else likes watching sports because that means less people are skiing and sailing.
          I make really good homemade pancakes and pasta, but anything else takes me at least 3 times longer than my wife, so I'm mostly the sous-chef/dish-washer.
          My dream is to someday have a family band.
